# YamPlate

YamPlate is an FR4 plate for mattdibi's YamPad. The original plate goes around the display, which I didn't want.

## ToDo
Add access holes for the mounting screws on the YamPad.<br>
The slots for the 2U keys are not pretty. 

## History
Rev 0.1 is unit tested for fit but does not have holes to access the mounting screws.
